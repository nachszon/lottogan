A program to generating integer pseudo-random numbers. Six numbers from the 49 pool are drawn (like in lotto). The author neither guarantees the prize nor incurs any costs incurred as a result of using the program. However, if you win a alot of many using this draw machine, ordinary politeness requires you to share the program with the author in a 1: 3 ratio. Three parts for the author of the program, one for the player :)
